graph problems

Theoratical model vs distributional programming framework:
works perfectly
works but needs works/efficiency is low
does not work at all

what can be the compatibility / incompatibility
1. Evaluating Performance
How this framework perform compare to another framework with the same message passing model and problem (Communication rounds, memory usage)
How the framework perform if the problem scales (Strong scaling and weak scaling senario)
2. Requirement from the programming framework
memory usage
CPU usage
network bandwidth
disk I/O

Give mathmatical proves

method:
Reading documentation of programming frameworks
Analyzing the compatibility of frameworks and models:
1. Using classical problems that requires HPC (Graph problems)
2. Designing algorithms using frameworks and models
3. Analysing performance from time and memory-wise and consider scaling
4. conclude the compatibility between a model and a framework
5. (Optional) Applying the algorithm on real machines to verify the result
plan:
6-month plan
Month 1

Month 2-3
Designing algorithms w.r.t. frameworks and models and give mathmatical proofs

Month 4
(Optional) Applying the algorithm on real machines to verify the result

Month 5-6
Writing thesis
