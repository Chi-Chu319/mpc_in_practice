\section{Research Purpose}
The purpose of this research is to explore and understand the compatibility between various message-passing frameworks (such as the k-machine model, congested clique, and BSP) and different distributed computing frameworks, including MPI, OpenMP, Pytorch, and TensorFlow.

Evaluation of Compatibility/Incompatibility:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{
    Evaluating Performance:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item How does this framework perform in comparison to another framework with the same message-passing model and problem, in terms of communication rounds and memory usage?
        \item How does this framework's performance change if the problem scales, in terms of strong scaling and weak scaling?
      \end{itemize}
    }
  \item {
    System Requirements from the Programming Framework:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Memory usage
        \item CPU usage
        \item Network bandwidth
        \item Disk I/O
      \end{itemize}
    }
\end{enumerate}

\section{Objective}
For a specific framework and model, the objective is to demonstrate one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The framework and model are perfectly compatible.
  \item The framework and model are compatible with some additional effort, enabling them to work together efficiently to solve problems.
  \item The framework and model are completely incompatible.
\end{itemize}
To demonstrate compatibility, algorithms will be presented with accompanying proofs. To indicate incompatibility, proofs will also be required.

\section{Method}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reviewing and understanding the documentation of programming frameworks.
  \item Analyzing the compatibility of frameworks and models:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Selecting classical problems that require High-Performance Computing (HPC), such as graph problems.
        \item Designing algorithms using the selected frameworks and models.
        \item Analyzing performance in terms of time and memory usage, considering scalability.
        \item Concluding the compatibility between a specific model and a framework.
        \item (Optional) Applying the algorithm on real machines to verify the results.
      \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Plan}
The duration of this research is planned for 6 months.

Months 1 - 2:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Literature Review. Conduct a comprehensive review of existing studies on MPI, OpenMP, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and message-passing models like the k-machine model, congested clique, and BSP.
  \item Selecting problems for analysis.
  \item Developing metrics for evaluating performance.
\end{itemize}

Months 3 - 4:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Design algorithms tailored to the frameworks and models, analyze their performance, and evaluate them using the developed metrics.
\end{itemize}

Months 5 - 6:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Writing the research report.
\end{itemize}

Optional:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Applying the algorithms on real machines to verify the results.
\end{itemize}
