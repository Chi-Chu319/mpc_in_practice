\Subject { This thesis investigates the performance of Congested Clique algorithms on modern supercomputers, specifically Puhti, a Finnish supercomputer hosted by CSC.\\ The study focuses on a representative algorithm, $MST\_\log \log {n}${}, which is implemented using two different programming paradigms: OpenMPI (Message Passing Interface) for CPUs and CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) for GPUs. The goal is to evaluate the compatibility of modern computing architectures with the Congested Clique model.\\ The evaluation examines several aspects, including how distributed computation and communication in the Congested Clique model are translated to supercomputer architectures, the overhead introduced by this translation, and the extent to which the theoretical time complexity of the algorithm holds in practice.\\ MPI is a standardized and portable message-passing library interface widely used for parallel computing, while CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general-purpose computing on GPUs.\\ }
